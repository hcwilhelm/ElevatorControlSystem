ElevatorControlSystem
---

###Task
Design and implement an elevator control system. What data structures, interfaces and algorithms will you need? Your
elevator control system should be able to handle a few elevators â€” say up to 16.

Can you please use Scala to implement it? In the end, your control system should provide an interface for:

1. Querying the state of the elevators (what floor are they on and where they are going),
2. receiving an update about the status of an elevator,
3. receiving a pickup request,
4. time-stepping the simulation.
